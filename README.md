# Lander-EDL-Simulation

An experimental project implying very basic physics to simulate a straight forward EDL procedure, mainly for personal use of learning C++.
Bugs exist in the code which have bleak chances to be fixed since this was just a dummy project, and I will be moving on to other things to make.
